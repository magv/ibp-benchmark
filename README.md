**How to choose IBPs topologies**

Idea:
* come up with some insights on how to choose IBPs topologies 

Summary:
1) to run the actual IBPs for a chosen topology (like a box)
2) come up with interesting topologies to try out (-> maybe ask Gudrun for advice)
3) basic idea -> try out different permutations 
    Freedom:
    - assign loop momenta 
    - irreducible numerators 
    - order of external momenta 
    - order of masters (like in Laporta algorithm)
4) run the reduction with the different permutations and compare 
    - preferably on the same hardware 
    - both with Kira and Fire 
    - we should also use both Fermat and finite flow.

ToDo:
1) read the papers 
2) learn how to use the programs by setting up simple examples 
3) proceed from there
